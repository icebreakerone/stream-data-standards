# How to suggest changes to Stream data standards

The [Stream data standards](data-standards.md) are a living document and are expected to change over time. The process for suggesting changes to the Stream data standards is as follows:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account (required).
2. Make the changes in your forked repository.
3. Raise a Pull Request (PR) in this repository with the changes you have made.

The PR will be reviewed by the Stream Advisory Group responsible. If the PR is accepted, it will be included in the next update of the Stream data standards put forward for approval.
